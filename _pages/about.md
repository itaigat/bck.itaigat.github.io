I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Professor [Tamir Hazan](https://ie.technion.ac.il/~tamir.hazan/tamir.html) at the [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/). I graduated with my BSc degree in Data Science and Engineering from the Technion.

My research is focused on the perception of deep learning classifiers, primarily with applications to multi-modal, Vision and Language, tasks. On a variety of well-known benchmarks, we discover surprising insights and achieve state-of-the-art results.
